This is just an addition to the Matrix class released with the Arduino (C)
software. A friend and I've been messing around with it, and I've wanted to
know more about the internals, so I've been poking around in the code, and 
adding some debug features. It's really nothing to see. I've also been meaning
to get a chance to get my fingers wet in Git/GitHub, and this seemed to be the
perfect opportunity, since I needed to be able to sync the files up between
multiple computers/operating systems.
